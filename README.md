## 🚀 Quickstart  

Get up and running in just a few commands!  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TUM-VT/FleetPy.git
cd FleetPy

# Set up the virtual environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fleetpy

# Run an example simulation
python run_examples.py
```

✔ The results will be saved in `FleetPy/studies/example_study/results/`  
✔ To visualize the results, run:  

```bash
python replay_pyplot.py scenario_result_directory
```

---

## 🛠 Installation  

### 1️⃣ Install with Conda (Recommended)

Ensure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed.

```bash
# Fetch the latest updates
git clone https://github.com/TUM-VT/FleetPy.git
cd FleetPy

# Set up a Conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fleetpy
```

### 2️⃣ Install C++ Router (Recommended)

For improved routing efficiency, compile the C++ router:

```bash
cd FleetPy/src/routing/cpp_router
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

**Ensure a C++ compiler and Cython are installed.**

### 3️⃣ Install Optimizer (Optional)

For advanced optimization tasks, install the necessary optimizers:

#### 🏆 **Gurobi**

To install Gurobi:

```bash
python -m pip install gurobipy==12.0.1
```

You can acquire a **free academic license** from [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/). 🎓

#### ⚡ **OR-Tools**

To install Google's OR-Tools:

```bash
pip install ortools
```

This is useful for combinatorial optimization and routing problems.

## 📂 Data Preparation and Study Setup

For now, you can inspect the data structures and files in the examples provided in GitHub:

* 📁 `FleetPy/data`
* 📁 `FleetPy/studies`

More detailed descriptions of the **data structure, preprocessing steps, and result data** will be provided in upcoming versions.
Additionally, a **GUI to set up scenarios** (with a choice of submodules and data) is planned for the future. 🎨

In general, you can **save your data and study definitions** in the mentioned directories. These are included in `.gitignore`.

<!-- ... (prepare study by config.csv and scenarios.csv) -->
<!-- ... (necessary modules for preprocessing can be installed by "pip3 install -r requirements_with_pp.txt") -->

## 📊 Running a Simulation  

To test an example scenario:  

```bash
python run_examples.py
```

✔ The output will be stored in:  
📂 `FleetPy/studies/example_study/results/`  

### 📊 Output Files

| File Name            | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `1_user_stats.csv`   | User request statistics |
| `2_0_op-stats.csv`   | Fleet vehicle task logs |
| `standard_eval.csv`  | Aggregated evaluation results |

To analyze trends:

```bash
python FleetPy/src/evaluation/temporal.py scenario_result_directory
```

---

## 🎥 Watch a Replay  

To visualize a **previously simulated scenario**, run:  

```bash
python replay_pyplot.py scenario_result_directory <sim_seconds_per_real_second>
```

🛑 *(Optional: Specify start time as an additional argument.)*

## Benchmark Data Sets

Input data and corresponding example scenario files are available for large-scale case studies of Manhattan, NY, Chicago, IL, and Munich, Germany. This data can be used as benchmark data sets to test and compare new algorithms or to set up large-scale simulations quickly. The FleetPy input data can be downloaded here and has to be copied into the FleetPy/data folder:

- Manhattan: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15187906
- Chicago: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15189440
- Munich: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15195726
