## 🚀 Quickstart  

Get up and running in just a few commands!  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TUM-VT/FleetPy.git
cd FleetPy

# Set up the virtual environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fleetpy

# Run an example simulation
python3 run_examples.py
```

✔ The results will be saved in `FleetPy/studies/example_study/results/`  
✔ To visualize the results, run:  

```bash
python3 replay_pyplot.py scenario_result_directory
```

---

## 🛠 Installation  

### 1️⃣ Install with Conda (Recommended)

Ensure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed.

```bash
# Fetch the latest updates
git clone https://github.com/TUM-VT/FleetPy.git
cd FleetPy

# Set up a Conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fleetpy
```

### 2️⃣ Install C++ Router (Recommended)

For improved routing efficiency, compile the C++ router:

```bash
cd FleetPy/src/routing/cpp_router
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

**Ensure a C++ compiler and Cython are installed.**

### 3️⃣ Install Optimizer (Optional)

For advanced optimization tasks, install the necessary optimizers:

#### 🏆 **Gurobi**

To install Gurobi:

```bash
conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/gurobi
conda install gurobi
```

You can acquire a **free academic license** from [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/). 🎓

#### ⚡ **OR-Tools**

To install Google's OR-Tools:

```bash
pip install ortools
```

This is useful for combinatorial optimization and routing problems.

## 📂 Data Preparation and Study Setup

For now, you can inspect the data structures and files in the examples provided in GitHub:

* 📁 `FleetPy/data`
* 📁 `FleetPy/studies`

More detailed descriptions of the **data structure, preprocessing steps, and result data** will be provided in upcoming versions.
Additionally, a **GUI to set up scenarios** (with a choice of submodules and data) is planned for the future. 🎨

In general, you can **save your data and study definitions** in the mentioned directories. These are included in `.gitignore`.

<!-- ... (prepare study by config.csv and scenarios.csv) -->
<!-- ... (necessary modules for preprocessing can be installed by "pip3 install -r requirements_with_pp.txt") -->

---

## 📊 Running a Simulation  

To test an example scenario:  

```bash
python3 run_examples.py
```

✔ The output will be stored in:  
📂 `FleetPy/studies/example_study/results/`  

### 📊 Output Files

| File Name            | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `1_user_stats.csv`   | User request statistics |
| `2_0_op-stats.csv`   | Fleet vehicle task logs |
| `standard_eval.csv`  | Aggregated evaluation results |

To analyze trends:

```bash
python3 FleetPy/src/evaluation/temporal.py scenario_result_directory
```

---

## 🎥 Watch a Replay  

To visualize a **previously simulated scenario**, run:  

```bash
python3 replay_pyplot.py scenario_result_directory <sim_seconds_per_real_second>
```
